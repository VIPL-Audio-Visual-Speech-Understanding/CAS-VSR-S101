## Introduction

The [CAS-VSR-S101 database](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cas-vsr-s101) is a Chinese Mandarin dataset intended for research related to audio-visual speech, released by the [audio-visual speech understanding team](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/en/research/speech/) at Visual Information Processing and Learning group, key Intelligent Information Processing Laboratory of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Please refer to the [license agreement](https://github.com/VIPL-Audio-Visual-Speech-Understanding/CAS-VSR-S101/blob/fec539cf3ee7b9a687bdbff00ee5bd2982b5bea2/CAS-VSR-S101-Release%20Agreement.pdf) in this repository and [supplementary materials](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Zhang_ES3_Evolving_Self-Supervised_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf) for the ESÂ³ paper for more details.

## Dataset Contents

The dataset includes:
- **Cropped lip sequences:** Cropped lip sequences from the videos.
- **Audio:** Synchronized audio recordings corresponding to the lip sequences.
- **Annotations:** Ground truth transcriptions for each video.
- **Metadata:** Additional information such as speaker identity (host, interviewer or interviewee), gender and whether the speaker speaks canonical Mandarin or dialectal Mandarin.

## Accessing the Dataset

To access the dataset, please scan the signed agreement and send it to [lipreading@vipl.ict.ac.cn](mailto:lipreading@vipl.ict.ac.cn). **Please note that the dataset is only available to universities and research institutes for research purposes only.** Note that the agreement should be signed by **a full-time staff member (usually your advisor).**  Sharing the dataset with others is **not allowed** under the terms of the agreement. For questions or further information, please contact us via e-mail.

## Data Privacy and Security
Due to data privacy concerns, only the lip region of the videos at a resolution of 96x96 pixels is available. Users are expected to comply with all guidelines and not re-distribute the data.
